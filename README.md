# Credit-card
Credit Card Fraud Detection is a classic class-imbalance problem where the number of fraud transactions is much lesser than the number of legitimate transaction for any bank. Most of the approaches involve building model on such imbalanced data, and thus fails to produce results on real- time new data because of overfitting on training data and a bias towards the majoritarian class of legitimate transactions. Most modern solutions leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to manage data analysis, predictive modeling, decision-making, fraud alerts and remediation activity that occur when individual instances of credit card fraud are detected.
